# GraphQL endpoint for Alfresco

This is an ACS project for Alfresco SDK 4.0.

To know more about GraphQL : https://graphql.org/

Declare the following endpoints:
- http://localhost:8080/alfresco/graphql : GraphQL endpoint read only.
- http://localhost:8080/alfresco/graphql_mutation : GraphQL endpoint that allows mutations.
- http://localhost:8080/alfresco/graphiql : UI to create queries. Test with that one.
